# Brickerton

## Inspiration
Commonly shared interest in internet ARGs led us to create one regarding RIT

## What it does
Currently displays markers on RIT campus that are populated via JSON files

## How we built it
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; we were able to use our both our own code and existing technologies to produce the foundations needed to tell our story.

## Challenges we ran into
* Deciding project structure
* Implementation of MapBox to our project

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Able to successfully collaborate and create a working demo of the foundational technology
* Team organization and contributions

## What we learned
* How to plan and begin a project
* Get each member up to speed on the technologies used
* Role and task distribution 

## What's Next?
* Create the lore for our ARG and implement features that would best tell the story to users!
